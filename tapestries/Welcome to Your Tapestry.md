# Welcome to your Tapestry

Welcome to your Tapestry, the place where you’ll weave your stories.

A **Tapestry** is your own corner of the world, shaped entirely by your imagination. **Anvil & Loom** exists to support that work: to give you a space to plan, explore, play, and keep track of everything that unfolds.

You’ll see a few starter folders in this Tapestry. They’re suggestions, not rules. Use them, rename them, delete them, or build your own structure from scratch. You’re in charge of how this world is organized.

This document is a sample **Entry**. Create as many Entries as you like. They can represent **People**, **Places**, **Things**, **Events**, **Factions**, **Mysteries**, or anything else you need. Use **Threads** to connect Entries together, tracing relationships, plots, questions, and consequences across your Tapestry.

Take a moment to explore the **Dice Tray**, **Oracles**, and **Tables**. By default, anything you roll there is automatically added to the **active Entry**, so your results stay tied to the context where they matter. If you prefer to log results manually, you can disable that behavior.

When you’re ready, rename this Entry or create a new one and start weaving.
