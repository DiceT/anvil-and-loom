Good catch, and yeah, we need to spell that out for Loomwright/Replit so they don’t “standardize” away the expand/collapse behavior.

Short answer:
I implied it with `variant="inline" | "entry"`, but let’s make it **explicit**: same data model, two **rendering modes**:

1. **Standard Result Card** (everywhere except Entry)
2. **Entry Result Card** (Entry log, collapsible CONTENT)

Here’s an updated snippet you can hand to Replit that clarifies this without rewriting the whole spec:

````text
IMPORTANT RESULT CARD DETAIL

There are TWO visual/result-card variants that share the same underlying model:

1) Standard Result Card (non-entry use)
   - Used in: Dice Tray / Dev panels / side panes / previews.
   - Always shows all three conceptual regions:
     - HEADER
     - CONTENT
     - RESULT
   - CONTENT is always visible in this mode.

2) Entry Result Card (inside a Journal Entry)
   - Used ONLY in the Entry log.
   - Shows HEADER and RESULT by default.
   - CONTENT is HIDDEN by default.
   - When the HEADER is clicked, the CONTENT toggles between HIDDEN and VISIBLE
     (expand/collapse behavior).
   - RESULT stays visible in both states.

Implementation guidance

- Keep a single unified data model (`ResultCardModel`) as previously described
  (DiceResultCard, TableResultCard, InterpretationResultCard).
- Implement a single renderer component, e.g. `ResultCard`, that accepts a prop:

  ```ts
  type ResultCardVariant = "standard" | "entry";

  interface ResultCardProps {
    card: ResultCardModel;
    variant: ResultCardVariant;
  }
````

* Behavior:

  * `variant: "standard"`

    * Render HEADER, CONTENT, and RESULT all visible.
    * HEADER is NOT a toggle in this mode.

  * `variant: "entry"`

    * Render HEADER and RESULT visible at all times.
    * CONTENT is inside a collapsible container.
    * Clicking the HEADER toggles the CONTENT container open/closed.
    * Keep this consistent across all card kinds (dice, challenge, table, interpretation).

Mapping for specific card kinds:

* Dice / Challenge cards:

  * HEADER: e.g. "CHALLENGE ROLL" (this card is the template for layout/chrome).
  * CONTENT: breakdown (dice rolled, stats, etc.).
  * RESULT: outcome (e.g. "Strong Hit", total, etc.).

* Table cards:

  * HEADER: e.g. "TABLE: BLIGHTED, OBJECTIVES".
  * CONTENT: context (table name, roll number, maybe source info).
  * RESULT: table row `resultText` (the prompt).

* Interpretation cards:

  * HEADER: e.g. "INTERPRETATION: THE LOOMWRIGHT".
  * CONTENT: the "Interpretation:" bullets (deeper oracle reading).
  * RESULT: the "Snapshot:" one-line vivid summary.

    * In Entry variant, show only the Snapshot by default; Interpretation bullets appear when expanded.

Usage:

* In all non-entry contexts (side panes, dev tools, quick views), call:

  ```tsx
  <ResultCard card={card} variant="standard" />
  ```

* When rendering cards in the Entry log, call:

  ```tsx
  <ResultCard card={card} variant="entry" />
  ```

Please preserve the existing CHALLENGE ROLL card appearance and behavior as the visual reference,
but refactor it to go through this unified `ResultCard` component with the correct variant.

```

If you paste that onto the end of the result-card refactor instructions I gave earlier, Replit will know:  
same card model, two display modes, with Entry mode doing the click-to-expand CONTENT while HEADER + RESULT stay present.
::contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
